# ShaderShop

ShaderShop is an online tool used for making shaders. Similar to shadertoy, but will have extra features, such as exporting shaders, converting shaders
to a different format, and converting ShaderShop shaders to Unity. 

## Documentation

ShaderShop uses the standard glsl format for shaders. The void main(void) function is the one that glsl uses as standard, but for easy export to shadertoy,
we have added a second function that is formated how Shadertoy is, so that you can easily import shadertoy shaders, and shadershop shaders to shadertoy.

*There will be more uniform variables coming soon!

## The Author

My name is Spencer Yonce. I am the creator of ShaderShop. I am a graphics programmer from central US. I absolutely love shaders and graphics and maths of
sorts. If you can't find me, I'm likely to be playing the piano or coding or playing with some new equations in a graphing calculator. :)
